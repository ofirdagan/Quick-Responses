Installation instructions taken from here - https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

1. Install nodejs-https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install Expo on your phone device(download from Appstore or Googleplay).
3. Open cmd on your computer and type the following commands:   "npm install -g create-react-native-app"
																"create-react-native-app AwesomeProject"
																"cd AwesomeProject"
																"npm i --save react-native-keyboard-input"
																"npm i --save react-native-autogrow-textinput"
																"npm i --save react-native-blur"
																
4. Copy the file App.js I provided and paste it in the directory of the project you created
   (should be in C:/users/username/AwesomeProject) and press "Replace the file in the destination"
5. In the cmd type "npm start"(still inside the AwesomeProject directory).
6. Open Expo on your device and press "Scan QR Code" and then scan the QR code from the cmd(press 'q' if it doesn't show).
7. The app should now be running. If not, make sure that your phone is connected by wifi to the same network as your computer.
Check that the ip address shown in the Expo app is the same as your computer ip address(type 'ipconfig' in the cmd).
If it isn't, it might be because you have installed a virtual machine on your computer and Expo is trying to use the
virtual machine's ip address. (happend to me)
To change the ip address used by Expo- type in the cmd: "set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=my_ip_address".
(taken from here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43696813/react-native-expo-change-default-lan-ip)
Now the app should work.
